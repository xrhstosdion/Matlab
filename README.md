Implementation of a simple Artificial Neural Network
MATLAB R2013a

The ANN which consists of 3 Preceptors is being trained in 3 categories with the samples from "train" array in data1 file with the desired outputs in "output" array, then is being tested with the samples from "test" array.

The samples from "train" array are represented with color Blue.
The samples from "test" array that got categorized with color Purple.
The samples from "test" array that could not get categorized are represented as Red Stars.
